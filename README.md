# Thinking of a song game

This is an interpretation of an old game a friend and I played while we played Minecraft online.

There are two rules:

1. One person thinks of a song
1. Other players may each guess once at one the song is

There are no clues, and each person gets only one guess. Once everyone has had a chance to guess, the song is revealed.

## Why did I want to build this?

- To regain familiarity with React
- It involves using an API
- Building an MVP is relatively simple, building other features could be fun
